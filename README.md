# Kaggle Competitions

#### Kaggle is a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions in which companies and researchers post data and statisticians and data miners compete to produce the best models for predicting and describing the data.

[## Competition 1 - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/cbroker1/Kaggle/tree/master/Titanic%20Machine%20Leaning%20from%20Disaster)
In this challenge, I completed the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, I applied the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
